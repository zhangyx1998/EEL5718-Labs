## `Tree` Topology - Yumeng Zhang

This Python script defines a mininet tree topology named 'MyTreeTopo'.

Description:
This topology consists of seven switches (s1, s2_1, s2_2, s3_1, s3_2, s4_1, s4_2) and eight hosts (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, h7, h8).

Starting from s1, the switches create a hierarchical branching structure, and the hosts are connected to the switches as follows:
h1 and h2 connect to s2_1;
h3 and h4 connect to s3_1;
h5 and h6 connect to s4_1;
h7 and h8 connect to s4_2.

Usage:
Using the following command to run this script in mininet:

sudo mn --custom mytreetopo.py --topo mytreetopo
